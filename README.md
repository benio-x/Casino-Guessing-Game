This code is a game you can play that is a mini casino guessing game. Here's how it works:

First, the game asks if you're ready to play. If you say no (by typing 'n' or 'N'), it ends, and the computer says "later then."
If you're ready to play (by typing 'y'), the game starts. The computer picks a random number between 1 and 50, but it keeps this number a secret.
The users job is to guess what number the computer is thinking of, you get 7 tries to guess the right number.
Each time you make a guess, the computer will tell you if your guess is too low or too high compared to the number it picked.
If you guess the number correctly within your 7 tries, you get a happy message!
If you don't guess the number in 7 tries, the game ends, and the computer tells you what the secret number was.
It's a simple guessing game to test your luck and see if you can figure out the computer's secret number with a limited number of guesses.
